leaf = node with no children

root = the very first node, the base node

recursion is used heavily with trees
    - each subtree is it's own little tree

    - to go through a tree, you recurse through subtrees

There is a logarithmic/exponential relationship between height of tree and total number of nodes

A binary search tree does not have to be perfect

Rules for Binary Search Tree:
    1. the left value is less than the node
    2. the right value is greater than the node
    3. all subtrees are valid binary search trees

A single node IS a valid binary search tree

BSTs are used a lot under the hood
    -- you probably won't need to implement one
